Try using a TreeMap and a HashMap instead of MyHashMap.
	Are the resulting word frequencies any different?
		The frequncies are no different. 
	
	Is the time performance any different? If so, how would you rank the three implementations (in increasing order of time complexity)?
		They are different and are as follows; hash, MyHash, Tree

How are % and Math.floorMod different? Which works more reliably for computing a hash table index?
	% gives you the remainder of 2 numbers while Math.floorMod gives the smallest number. Math.floormod is more reliable. 

What is the time complexity of MyHashMap.size(), and how could you make it much more efficient?
	0(n). You make it more effiencint by making the size bigger. 

How does this implementation compare to one where you would directly use your linked Node class from the earlier assignment? Answer briefly in terms of ease of implementation, correctness, reliability, and performance.
	Linkedlist was easier to implement and the code looked more tidy. Both of them were reliable but hashmap had the superior performance.
